Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/haipham1202/chestx-ray14-v3

This Dataset consists of three classes of X-rays - Normal, Pneumonia and Covid19.

We apply various preprocessing techinques like Gaussian Filter, Median Filter, Mean Filter and etc. (Gaussian Filter Yields better results)

We use Various pretrained models in imagenet. 

Through the techniques applied we could obtain an accuracy upto 92%
